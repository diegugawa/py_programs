This program converts Celsius degrees to Fahrenheit or viceversa.
I developed it to teach a few folks how to create their own websites.
While this is the typical program that you could create when you are learning how to code,
it can be consider on a medium level because it's elegant (what I have been told :) ), and
avoid exiting errors in case someone have pressed the wrong keystrokes.
