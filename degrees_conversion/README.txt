This program converts Celsius degrees to Fahrenheit or viceversa.
I developed it to uploaded to a simple website or app that requires a few prompts and runs free of errors.
This is the typical basic program that you can create on your own when you are learning to code, 
but with some medium level changes to avoid errors exiting the programs when you have pressed the wrong
keystrokes.
